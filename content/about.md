XMPP (E**x**tensible **M**essaging and **P**resence **P**rotocol) is like a common language both your and your chat partner's app speak to each other.
Similar to email, there is a service provider managing your account and messages.
That provider speaks XMPP too.

But some XMPP providers support functionalities that other providers do not.
Some support registrations via your app and some only via their websites.
Some provide more space for sharing media than others or store them longer than others.
The curated list of XMPP providers on this website makes it easy for you to find a suitable provider.

This website uses data from [XMPP Providers](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers).
All properties of the included providers are [automatically checked](/faq/#where-do-we-have-the-providers-properties-from) on a daily basis and updated if needed.

Help us make _free communication_ possible and [contribute to XMPP Providers](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or [improve this website](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp-providers-website)!

## History

XMPP Providers arose from [Kaidan](https://www.kaidan.im)'s onboarding introduced in [Kaidan 0.5](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/04/06/kaidan-0.5.0/).
The goal was to speed up the onboarding by making registrations as simple as possible.

Until then, a usual onboarding raised the following questions:
1. Which *username* should I take?
1. Which *password* should I take?
1. Which *provider* should I take?

[Melvin Keskin](https://invent.kde.org/melvo) and [Edward Maurer](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/User:Echolon) wanted to tackle the third question.
There were several approaches on the web but none provided a good user experience via a curated list.
Furthermore, there were no criteria for recommended providers.
Thus, we created a list containing all properties of providers relevant to the users during the onboarding.

Because the approach worked out for Kaidan, we decided to spin it off as an independent project.
That way, other apps could use our list as well.
Since then, we added more providers, filtering, results, badges and [apps that integrate XMPP Providers](/apps/).

Finally, [Daniel Br√∂tzmann](https://github.com/cal0pteryx) joined our team.
He created this wonderful website and helped us with many great contributions.
Together with him, the XMPP Providers team developed bots to automatically gather the provider properties.
That automation made it possible to add even more providers and introduce new properties while keeping everything up to date.
