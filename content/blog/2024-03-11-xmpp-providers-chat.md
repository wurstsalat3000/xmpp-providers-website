## Come Join Us

After [automating](/blog/2023-12-29-xmpp-providers-fully-automated/) almost all the work necessary for querying [provider properties](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/README.md#properties), we were able to start adding new providers! There are 59 providers on the list at this moment :tada: which enables us to show some [statistics](/statistics/) as well.

For most of the questions regarding the project (how properties can be provided by server admins and so on), the [FAQ section](/faq/#where-do-we-have-the-providers-properties-from) provides you with answers.

However, if your questions were not answered there, we invite you to [join our new chat](/contact/) ([join directly](xmpp:support@chat.xmpp-providers.org?join)).
Feel free to discuss XMPP Providers related topics!

## Spread the Word

The project lives from the community and client implementations, so [follow us and spread the word](https://fosstodon.org/@xmpp_providers)!
